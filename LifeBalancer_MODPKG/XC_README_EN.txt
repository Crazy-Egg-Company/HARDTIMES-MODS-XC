This mod makes everyday life easier as a homeless person in a Country like Austria.
The opening times of the shops are also adjusted to Austria.
However, only slightly so that the survival factor is preserved.

I take great care that all things are always balanced and realistically modified.
All adjustments are based on the legal system in Austria.
A country that is social towards the homeless (mostly).

However, in order to maintain the survival factor, we have not simplified the whole thing too much.
It should still be challenging or?! :o)

!!!!!!! HOW TO INSTALL THIS MOD !!!!!!! 

Start your game and use the "Mods" button. Then click on the button to display the Mod folder.
Now just drag the mod folder "LifeBalancer_MODPKG" into this folder.
It is important that this folder is in the same folder as "Vanilla".

Now restart your game and click on Mods again.
Now you should be able to select the mod in the left view.
Click on it to set it to active (right column under Vanilla).

Done! Now press the ESC key and follow the instructions to restart the game.
Now load your save status and confirm loading the mod.

The game will warn you that installing mods is dangerous and could damage your save status.
However, we take great care that we only modify things that have no effect on your save status!
For security reasons, you should still duplicate your current save status! (save a second time under another name).

take care & keep surviving!
