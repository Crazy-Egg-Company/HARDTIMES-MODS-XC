##################################

1.) Weather update
From now on there is "gentler" (Austria) weather.
The conditions are not that hard anymore and it doesn't rain so much and you don't freeze all the time.

2.) Blue Berries
Collecting blue berries is no longer considered criminal. (+ Spawn rate improved)

3.) Alcohol is bad but also good
the speed reduction was loosened a little so that you are no longer traveling as slowly :)
Crime was also removed because alcohol is permitted in public in Austria.

4.) Breaking doors not more causing end of the world
5.) Being caught stealing doesn't mean the end anymore
6.) Church flyers now also reduce crime a bit

7.) Smoking cigarettes
is now more harmful to health than before, but it also increases stamina and speed values ​​more.
In addition, you feel fuller after smoking, but also get a little dirtier (it stinks and your mouth .. ugh ^^)

8.) The Firebin
now gives you stamina and lowers your crime somewhat.
In Austria it is forbidden to make a fire without a permit, but we say that Firebins are public fireplaces.
This allows homeless people to warm up and recharge their batteries and lower their criminality as police officers see that they are sitting peacefully by the fire and warming up.

9.) Fishing is no longer as criminal now
10.) Eating cause less stomach problems and give you a little more stamina
11.) Gastro Boy now also gives some stamina and speed

12.) Joints
A somewhat extensive topic, but briefly explained, gives you life now since not a single death due to canabis is known.
You now get some life and your crafting speed increases instead of decreasing (you can get very creative by consuming cannabis). Your stamina also increases (you feel intoxicated)! You will get dirty and slow anyway and it will remain criminal! Laws ...;)

13.) Washing in public now creates less trouble

14.) Rain
if it rains you get more anonymity (less crime points) because the police are reluctant to go out when it rains and you are therefore more unobserved.

15.) Lightening up in public now creates less trouble!
16.) Sleep is now more worthwhile!
17.) Shopping with smugglers is less annoying!
18.) During sprinting you lose the wanted level
19.) Rummaging in the trash now makes for less trouble
20.) Fever makes less damage

21.) Shop opening times
Apparel, Books, Food, Grow & Hardware shops are now open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.
